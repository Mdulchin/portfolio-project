            <h4>Hi, I'm Madeline, a hand embroidery artist and software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY.</h4>
            <p>Iâ€™m a 2023 Flatiron School graduate looking to apply my software engineering skills to front and/or backend projects. At Flatiron I learned Javascript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, CSS, HTML, and, most importantly, the ability to efficiently and thoroughly master a new programming language. I love working as part of a team, and am open to remote, on-site, or hybrid work. 
            Before Flatiron I graduated from Bates College with a degree in English. I then worked as customer service representative at Unum Insurance. At the same time, I took my passion, hand embroidery, from a hobby to a business, selling custom work through Etsy and Instagram.</p>
